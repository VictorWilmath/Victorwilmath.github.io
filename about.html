        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p> "Why is it so ugly" is a question I expect to be asked atleast once in relation to this site. The primary answer is that I just really like minimalist websites like this. My inspiration for this site's style was <a href="https://berkshirehathaway.com/">berkshirehathaway.com</a>. In a world where people over-engineer convulated personal websites with react and css styles, I think theres a beauty in something minimalist like this. <span class="spoiler">I also just really dislike web development.</span> </p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>As stated on this websites homepage, my name is Victor Wilmath and I am a sophmore electrical engineering student at Penn State Harrisburg. My interests are RF technology and control systems. As of right now, I have no relevant internship or job experience in engineering, the closest I have is a summer job at a truck stop. I wish to change this soon and I am actively looking for internship positions for summer 2025. If you like what you see here, my contact information is listed at the top of this page. </p>
