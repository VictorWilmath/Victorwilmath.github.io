                    After over a year of applying and being rejected, I have finally received an internship offer. This one in particular comes from Letterkenny Army Depot. I think I'd like to use this post to reflect on my search, and pin down what I think exactly got me the offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spent my freshman year just sort of randomly tossing out internship applications, without any real sense of what I should be putting on them, or how to even reach out to the people I was submitting these to. It did not help that I was a freshman, and had literally zero relevant experience to help as an engineering intern. With zero personal projects, no difficult classes, and no connections, I was just tossing out applications to a quiet crowd. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over this previous summer, I start actually working on some real projects. Over spring break last semester, I worked on a little AI project, but that wasn't particually relevant to what employers are looking for from me. So, over summer break, I started the radio telescope. Aside from teaching me a good bit about RF engineering, it also served as an excellent personal development experience. This of course, is just corporate talk for "IT LOOKS GOOD ON MY RESUME". I think having this was a really good boost to making me stand out as an applicant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Towards the beginning of the fall semester, PSU Harrisburg hosted a career fair, with focus on engineering disciplines. While i handed out resumes to a dozen or so companies, Letterkenny stood out to me in particular. The man at the booth said electrical engineers were very much on demand in the depot, and that I could expect to work in controls as an intern. I liked this prospect, as I think controls engineering is just a cool field. As a side tangent, I've noticed I just graviate to things I find "cool". This philosphy I've dubbed as "8-year-oldism". I have found this to be a pretty good way to make sure I'm not burnt out, as I'll always be able to look forward to doing "cool" things. Anyways, back to the internship. I handed out my resume to the man at the booth, shook hands, and went off. A few weeks go by and I get an email asking me if I'd like to tour and sit down for a group interview. In engineering, you don't get far by saying no, so I accepted the offer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's sort of embarrasing to admit, but I have never been on a factory floor before. I found myself really enamoured by the systems and processes I saw at Letterkenny. I'm also an absolute GEEK when it comes to military technology, so I was stoked seeing HIMARS and Patriot batteries up close, it was super neat. While we were on our facility tour, one of our guides kept "wink wink nudge nudging" about how they really needed a controls intern for the summer. Not one to not capitalize on an oppurtunity, I ended up talking heavily about PLC (progammable logic controllers) during the interview portion, and wrote (in my opinion) a really strong proposal essay for how I'd like to assist PLC standardization. I think this is what ultimately netted me my offer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think Letterkenny is a super impressive facility, and im heavily looking forward to working there over the summer. As for this blog portion of the site, I have just implemented its functionality today, after procrastinating it for several months. I hope to write an article weekly, just discussing student life, career development, and reviewing/discussing various books I read. This is moreso meant to act as a professional diary for me to look back on over the years, but I hope to maybe appeal to atleast some people with it. Anyways, that all I really have to discuss for this article.
